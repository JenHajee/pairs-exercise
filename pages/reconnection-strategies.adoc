Usecase description - what this topic is trying to do or solve (business usecase)

When a Mule app starts, a connectivity test runs on components, such as the HTTP or FTP connector, to connect to an external server. If the connectivity test fails, the default behavior is to log a warning message and continue with the deployment of the app, instead of blocking the deployment.

You can modify this behavior by setting a number of reconnection attempts to try after an initial failure and by forcing the deployment to fail when all connection attempts fail.

* Reconnect (`reconnect`): Limits the number of reconnection attempts and the interval at which to execute them. For example, you might set a count of five reconnection attempts at a `frequency` of every `4000` milliseconds (ms). Defaults to two reconnection attempts at a frequency of `2000ms`.

Example that fails after five reconnection attempts are exhausted:

</http:request-config>

* Reconnect Forever (`reconnect-forever`): Attempts to reconnect at a given interval, for example, every `4000` ms for as long as the app runs. Defaults to every `2000` ms. Because there is no limit on the number of retries, no value for `count` is specified.

Example that does not set a limit on the number of reconnection attempts:

----
* Fail Deployment (`failsDeployment`): Forces the deployment to fail if the connection fails and any configured reconnection attempts are exhausted.
